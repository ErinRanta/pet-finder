# pet-finder

## Team members:

Lucy Gelderloos, Kyel Boisseau, Hayden Cleaver, and Erin Ranta

## Problem Domain

A place to find your new pet! Search animal type, location, and more.

There are so many animals that are put down every year, we want to make it accessible for people to find the pet of their dreams from a shelter, and in the meantime save an animals life!

## Frameworks and Libraries

We will be using API's from [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/) and [AdoptAPet](https://www.adoptapet.com/public/apis/pet_list.html).

## Semantic Versioning

1.0.0 8/1/2022, implemented initial details of project

## User Stories

1. As a pet lover, I want to adopt a pet from a shelter to help decrease animal euthanization.

2. As a parent, I would like an application to help determine that the pet is compatiable with kids so the pet and my children are safe.

3. As a person with severe allergies, I would like a to be able to search for a pet that is hypoallergenic.

4. As a person whom already has a dog, I would like to know if the pet I am searching is compatable with other dogs.

5. As a perspective pet owner, I would like to know more about specific breeds of cats or dogs.

## Cooperation Plan

Lucy (strengths): front-end, project organization/management.
Kyel(strengths): collaboration, back-end, teamwork
Hayden(strengths): back-end, overall vision of the flow of the project.
Erin(strengths): design, front-end, teamwork.

We will make use of our strengths accordingly, and we will support each other so we can all learn and be a part of the whole project.

Professional competencies to build upon:
Erin would like to build her technical skills.
Lucy would like to build her backend skills.
Hayden would like to work on working on smaller pieces and updating vs.large chunks of the projects al at once.
Kyel would like to work on:

## Conflict Plan

1. If we encounter conflict, we agree to come together and talk it out as a group.

2. If someone is not adequately contributing, we will see if they are ok first, and if any help is needed. If they are unreachable, we will talk to Jacob about next steps. We will not assume that someone is delibratley blowing off the project.

3. The process to resolve conflicts will be similar as above, we will keep open lines of communication and bring it to Jacob if need be.

4. We will escalate the measures to resolve a conflict (bringing it to Jacob or instructional team) if we are not able to resolve and we are not able to find common ground.

## Communication Plan

1. We will communicate via Slack after hours and on the weekend. We will also communicate in Remo.

2. We will check in on someone if they seem quiet. Double check they are not on mute. Message them 1:1 first, maybe they do not feel as comfortable talking but we will let them know they can speak anything on their mind.

3. As said above, we will be aware if someone is seeming not as comfortable and try to assure them it is a safe space.

## Project Scope

MVP will be that users can successfully make a filtered search the criteria from the user stories (location, kid friendliness, allergy friendliness, other pet friendliness, and particular species).

If the animal is a particular breed, we will present more information about that breed.

Stretch: Images of the (or some) of the animals.

Favorite: User can save their favorite pets to a "wish list".

## Git Process

Our Git plan is to, at the end of the day, push our work  up on our own branches. Then the next morning, while together, we will merge the work to 'main'. Next, we will individualy pull 'main' to our local machines.
This way, when we begin working on the new day we will be all caught up and avoid gituations.
